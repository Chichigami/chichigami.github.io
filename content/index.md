# Gary Feng

I have a B.S. in Statistics from University at Buffalo SUNY (not SUNY Buffalo). I was trained as a opthamologist (the study of diseases of the eye) technician, and have been learning backend development. This website is a fork/clone of my static site generator project. Do not expect fancy UX design here. The base coloring of the website is inspired by GMK Olivia. I also know that the markdown parser is "buggy" and will probably fix it for the code block. I really like Discord's codeblock color schemes.
