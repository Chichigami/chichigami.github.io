# Gary Feng's Portfolio

I have a B.S. in Statistics, worked in healthcare, and learning backend development. This website is a fork/clone of my static site generator project.
Do not expect fancy UX design here. The base coloring of the website is inspired by GMK Olivia. I also know that the markdown parser is "buggy" and will probably fix it for the code block. I really like Discord's codeblock color schemes.

## Projects I have done

- [This Website](https://github.com/Chichigami/chichigami.github.io)
- [Pokedex](https://github.com/Chichigami/pokedex)
  - This is a REPL that uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). You can find routes, catch and inspect pokemons. There is simple caching to ensure optimal speeds as well as not accidentally DOSing the server.
- [RSS aggregator](https://github.com/Chichigami/blog-aggregator)
  - WIP
- [Wordle in Scala](https://github.com/Chichigami/scala-wordle)
  - I learned Scala back in University and I wanted to relearn it. There has been huge changes to the language since I last used it, so I made a simple wordle REPL. I never got in on the wordle craze, so this is my entry to the Wordle craze. Because there isn't a word bank now due to NYT acquisition, I didn't implement a word checker.
  - Will add a generic dictionary and DB in the future.
- [Maze creator and solver](https://github.com/Chichigami/maze-solver)
  - Using Python's tktinker, this is a maze creator as well as solver.
- [Asteroids in Pygame](https://github.com/Chichigami/asteroids)
  - Asteroids made with pygame library.
