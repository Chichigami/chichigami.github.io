# My Notes

These are the notes I have while studying. I use Joplin, but I don't like the markdown for it. Might try Obsidian.
I use a two part system to take my notes. The first part is just quickly jotting down notes/code snippets, and then I come back to it another day to organize and condense the information. A lot of the code blocks are messed up because of my redumentary implementation of markdown. I will fix this another day.
