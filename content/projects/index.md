# Projects

Here are some of the projects I have done

- [This Website](https://github.com/Chichigami/chichigami.github.io)

  - The website you're on
  - Upgraded clone of my [static site generator](https://github.com/Chichigami/static-site)
  - Made my own markdown parser
  - Buggy

- [Pokedex](https://github.com/Chichigami/pokedex)

  - This is a REPL that uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). You can find routes, catch and inspect pokemons.
  - Caching to ensure blazingly fast results (also to not accidentally DOS the server)

- [RSS aggregator](https://github.com/Chichigami/blog-aggregator)

  - A collection of RSS feeds stored in a PostgreSQL database.
  - sqlc + Goose migration
  - WIP

- [Wordle in Scala](https://github.com/Chichigami/scala-wordle)

  - I was introduced to Scala back in University. There has been huge changes to the language since I last used it, so I made a simple Wordle REPL.
  - I never got in on the wordle craze, so this is my entry to the Wordle craze. Because there isn't a public word bank anymore, I didn't implement a word checker.
  - Will change word bank to a generic dictionary and DB in the future.

- [Maze creator and solver](https://github.com/Chichigami/maze-solver)

  - Using Python's tktinker, this is a maze creator as well as solver.

- [Asteroids in Pygame](https://github.com/Chichigami/asteroids)
  - Asteroids made with pygame library.
