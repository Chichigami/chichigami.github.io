        <div><h1>Gary Feng</h1><p>I have a B.S. in Statistics from University at Buffalo SUNY (not SUNY Buffalo). I was trained as a opthamologist (the study of diseases of the eye) technician, and have been learning backend development. This website is a fork/clone of my static site generator project. Do not expect fancy UX design here. The base coloring of the website is inspired by GMK Olivia. I also know that the markdown parser is "buggy" and will probably fix it for the code block. I really like Discord's codeblock color schemes.</p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:g.feng.work@gmail.com">g.feng.work@gmail.com</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Chichigami">Github</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-feng-847156241/">LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href="https://www.boot.dev/u/chichigami">Bootdev</a></p><h2>Games that I play</h2><p>Like most people that get into programming; I enjoy playing games.
